FIXME SOON: 

Caught exception: "System call msync failed in FileChunk"

Removed the underlying file while it was open, then closed the torrent.

In a torrent with a file size 0, set to high priority.
"Connection read fd(108) state(5) "StorageConsolidator::get_chunk_part(...) caught a piece with 0 lenght""



FIXME LATER:

Caught exception: "DownloadWrapper::resume_save() called with wrong state"

Pressed ^D during hash check/resume check.
