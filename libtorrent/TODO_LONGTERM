=== Session management ==

Add a command to tie a torrent to the life-time of a file. When that
file is deleted, stop or delete the torrent.

To support this, use different states (enum) for each torrent;
STOPPED, STARTED, DEFUNCT(?), LOADING(?), SCHEDULED. When this is
available, it should be possible to temporarily stop all torrents and
remove DEFUNCT when quitting rtorrent. The latter could be used when
the user deletes the file it is tied to.


== Global and Download specific variables ==

There are various things, ties to files, peer connection type etc that
should be in a generic variable container thingie. In addition there
should be a template for new downloads, download factory etc. The
download factory's being given to the new download.

Remember that we currently don't save sessions for inactive torrents.


== Configurable keybindings ==

...


== Combine taskScheduler and displayScheduler ==

Use a dirty flag to indicate that we need to redraw.


== Delegator rework ==

Keep multiple downloads of the same block seperate. When done, and
hash checking fails, compare pieces and merge/mark equal pieces. Those
would have higher priority when comparing, but not absolute.

The anonymous mmap'ed regions would contain different dtor functor
than file chunks.


== Sockets ==

Look into increasing the socket buffers. This would allow us to queue
more data for each poll event. But make sure we only get polled when
the buffer can take a nice amount of data.

The goal would be to push as much data into the buffer per event as
possible if it is uploading fast.


== Improve logging ==

...


== Disk worker thread ==

A worker thread that gets activated to do stuff like hashing and
syncing to disk. This would have the benefit of avoiding SIGBUS due to
full disk as msync can be called blockingly.

Before work can start on this, a threading library needs to be
available. Possibly the TR2 stuff?


== Tracker scrape ==

Add tracker scraping and display connected/not-connected seeds and
leechers.

In the mean time, parse the extra information the official tracker
transmits on requests.


== typedefs or more restrictive types for chunk indices, ports and such ==

These would include defines for invalid states etc.
