== Sockets ==

Look into increasing the socket buffers. This would allow us to queue
more data for each poll event. But make sure we only get polled when
the buffer can take a nice amount of data.


== Disk worker thread ==

A worker thread that gets activated to do stuff like hashing and
syncing to disk. This would have the benefit of avoiding SIGBUS due to
full disk as msync can be called blockingly.
