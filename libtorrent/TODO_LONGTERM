== Sockets ==

Look into increasing the socket buffers. This would allow us to queue
more data for each poll event. But make sure we only get polled when
the buffer can take a nice amount of data.


== Disk worker thread ==

A worker thread that gets activated to do stuff like hashing and
syncing to disk. This would have the benefit of avoiding SIGBUS due to
full disk as msync can be called blockingly.


== Tracker scrape ==

Add tracker scraping and display connected/not-connected seeds and
leechers.


== typedefs or more restrictive types for chunk indices, ports and such ==

These would include defines for invalid states etc.


== Combine taskScheduler and displayScheduler ==

Use a dirty flag to indicate that we need to redraw.


== Improve logging ==

...


== Delegator rework ==

Keep multiple downloads of the same block seperate. When done, and
hash checking fails, compare pieces and merge/mark equal pieces. Those
would have higher priority when comparing, but not absolute.

The anonymous mmap'ed regions would contain different dtor functor
than file chunks.
