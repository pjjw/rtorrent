Remove cruft from download.h, it needs to be slick since most parts of
libtorrent do their stuff through it. Perhaps separate out all the
callback stuff into it's own class.

DownloadChunk::interested should take into consideration chunks being
downloaded?

Randomize the chunks list so we don't start all downloads at the same spot.

Make peer::connection::read* static?

put stuff in delegator, remove the Download ptr from peer_connection
delegator should have a pointer to Download's peer list. finished
chunks are canceled from there. (or just take the list from delegator
and do stuff in peer_connection)

Rewrite old for loops.

Find out how to make autoconf use big files.

Add the option to not throw non-critical exceptions. This lets the
client be ignorant of errors while creating stuff. (Make some kind of
C friendly layer ontop)

Support compact tracker query.

Add support for reading the library version.

Add umask for both dir and file creation.

Let the client retrive the file names in the torrent. (Add support for all in one string, or path broken up)

Setting for pipelining requests.

Make request list keep choked requests, though it needs to be done in some other way.

After 25 seconds, choke a peer if no requests have been received?

Add time to choked/unchoked connections so we know how long ago it was.

Prettify unchoking due to INTERESTED.

Add average, max and total to rates. Will this be controlled by choke/unchoke?

Set IP TOS

Clean up total bytes up/down in download

Optimize Rate::rate()

Choke Cycle shouldn't cycle a peer that was unchoked the last cycle.

Add a snub factor. The more you upload without getting back, the higher it goes. Add a start buffer.

Use BitFieldCounter in delegator to choose a fiting chunk.

Remove stringAsHex stuff

configure does the peer id id thingie

pc::write PIECE with wrong index is not internal error

add unroll loops optimizing(?)

Add config for how often we unchoke unknown peers vs good uploaders

Consider splitting up download_state's peer connection management and choking stuff.
