Just some personal notes on what needs to be done when making a
release.

* Download a couple torrents using Valgrind.

* Check both client and library version number.
* Commit any changes.
* Package releases.
* Upload to host.

* Download, compile and test.
* Tag the release in SVN.
* Update frontpage, send mail to the ML, update ChangeLog page.
