  <title>Http handler</title>


<section id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
LibTorrent depends on the client to handle http downloads, thus the
library does not have a dependency on any specific http library. The
library provides a base class named torrent::Http with virtual member
functions that the client must implement, and a sigc++ slot which must
be set to create an instance of the derived torrent::Http class when
called.  
</para>

<para>
The torrent::Http class and the factory slot related functions can be
found in the header "torrent/http.h". The http handler should have
reasonable connection timeouts, be non-blocking and not do reconnects
on failed downloads.
</para>

<section id="factory"><title>Factory Slot</title>

<para>
The client registers the desired factory slot with the static
torrent::Http::set_factory member function. Using sigc++ the client
may bind values to the arguments of their function to avoid depending
on globals. The factory slot must return a pointer to a new instance
with the base type torrent::Http, and the caller takes responsibility
of deleting the object. (Note: consider making the cleanup a slot)
</para>

</section>


<section id="stream"><title>Output Stream</title>

<para>
The data downloaded by the http handler is to be written to
torrent::Http::m_stream which is a pointer to an std::iostream. The
http handler must not change any of the flags on the stream.
</para>

</section>


<section id="signals"><title>Signals</title>

<para>
There are two mutually exclusive signals that are called when the
download has stopped. The signal torrent::Http::m_signalDone is called
if the download was successful and torrent::Http::m_stream contains
the complete data. Or if the download was unsuccessful for some
reason, then torrent::Http::m_signalFailed is called with an error
message.
