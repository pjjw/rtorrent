C = Choked
UC = UnChoked
I = Interested
UI = UnInterested
CC = Download's CHOKE_CYCLE
BC = Download::balanceChoke

Starts C and UI.

If I is received, call BC. // might hide bugs, only unchoke *this*?
If UN is received, choke and call BC.

Update the C/UN timer as soon as the command is sent. (reuse of choke wait timer)

Timer for remote C/UN, add to Sub, use for snub.


CC is called every 30 seconds:

* Find the worst peer and choke him.
* Find an untried peer or a good peer and unchoke him.

This should (always?) try out unknown peers.


BC

* If peers need to be C: Find the S worst UC peers and C them.
* If peers need to be UC: Find the S best C and I peers and UC them. (TODO: Check for snub)

We should add some more stuff that checks how many chunks the peer has and stuff like that.
