TESTS (PRELIMINARY)

   The higher number of page faults in rtorrent happens since mmap'ed
   blocks of the file might not be in memory when it tries to
   read/write. Even though the official BitTorrent client uses python,
   that shouldn't have this much impact on CPU usage.

LIBRARY SIZE

   Due to extensive use of nested template algorithms the library gets
   bloated when including debugging information. As of 0.1.8 the library
   is 2.6Mb and striping reduces it to 250Kb. Obviously stable releases
   should disable debugging information in 'configure'. The library
   contains some template functions that are over 1000 character long
   which c++ mangles into 300+ character names. Strip is your friend ;)
