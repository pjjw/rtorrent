LICENSE

 GNU GPL, see COPYING. "libtorrent/src/utils/sha_fast.{cc,h}" is
originally from the Mozilla NSS and is under a triple license; MPL,
LGPL and GPL. An exception to non-NSS code has been added for linking
to OpenSSL as requested by Debian, though the author considers that
library to be part of the Operative System and thus linking is allowed
according to the GPL.

 Use whatever fits your purpose, the code required to compile with
Mozilla's NSS implementation of SHA1 has been retained and can be
compiled if the user wishes to avoid using OpenSSL.

LIBRARY DEPENDENCIES

  libsigc++ 2.0 (deb: libsigc++-2.0-dev)
  g++ >= 3.3

SIGC++

 The API will use sigc++ signals to give the client a simple, yet
powerful way of reacting to events from the library. The client can
hook multiple slots on each signal and modify the parameters to suit
the functions. This avoids lots of unnecessary code in the client.

POLLING

 "libtorrent/src/torrent/poll.h" provides an abstract class for
implementing any kind of polling the client wishes to use. Currently
epoll and select based polling is included.
