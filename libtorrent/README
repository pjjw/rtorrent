  libsigc++ 2.0 (deb: libsigc++-2.0-dev)
  openssl       (deb: libssl-dev)

SIGC++

 The API will use sigc++ signals to give the client a simple, yet
powerful way of reacting to events from the library. The client can
hook multiple slots on each signal and modify the parameters to suit
the functions. This avoids lots of unnecessary code in the client.

MADVISE WILLNEED KERNEL BUG

 On the 2.4.20 kernels I've tried, the madvise(..., MADV_WILLNEED)
system call can look up the kernel. Use the --disable-madvice to
disable it.
