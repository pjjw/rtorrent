This is the test client for libtorrent. Dog food. Note that decreasing
max peers does not yet disconnect them.

This client is just something i've been throwing togheter as i
finished implementing stuff in the library. When i'm finished with the
important parts of the library the API will be rewritten to something
more usable. I will also do a complete rewrite of the client.

If your system doesn't have "execinfo.h", uncomment "#define
USE_EXECINFO" in rtorrent.cc. This will be handled by an autoconf
script later.
