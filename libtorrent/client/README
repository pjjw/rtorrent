This is the test client for libtorrent. Note that decreasing max peers
does not yet disconnect them.

This client is just something i've been throwing togheter as i
finished implementing stuff in the library. When i'm finished with the
important parts of the library the API will be rewritten to something
more usable. I will also do a complete rewrite of the client. I hope
the new client will have a more intuitive interface and better layout.

If your system doesn't have "execinfo.h", uncomment "#define
USE_EXECINFO" in rtorrent.cc. This will be handled by an autoconf
script later.

Files that start with "http://" are downloaded. The "Http:" counter on
the bottom of the main page shows how many downloads are in
progress. This includes tracker requests. Check the logs 'l' to see if
the download of a torrent failed. You can also add torrents with the
Enter key.
