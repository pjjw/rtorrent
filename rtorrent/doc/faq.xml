        How do I add new torrents while the client is running?

        Use the backspace key to enter file input mode. The bottom
        line will change into a prompt which allows you to enter URL's
        or file paths to torrents. File name completion and directory
        listing is supported with the tab key.

        How does the session feature work?

      <answer><para>
        When you start the client you can use the "-s" switch to
        specify a session directory. The client will save all
        currently running torrents in the session directory and fast
        resume data will be written when the client exits. Upon
        restarting the client it will resume all the torrents in the
        session directory. Note that the filenames must be in the
        "<info_hash_hex>.torrent" format.
