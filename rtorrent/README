BUILDING

 Run "./autogen.sh" to generate the configure scripts if
nessesary. The man page "doc/rtorrent.1" must be generated with
"docbook2man rtorrent.1.xml" if it is missing.

 Note that rtorrent follows the development of libtorrent closely, and
thus the versions must be in sync. This should not be nessesary in the
future, when the library API stabilizes.
